???

* I have been writing code professionally for more or less 5 years

* main fields of interest include systems architecture and design patterns in
  order to build scalable and maintainable systems, apps or services

* worked mainly with UNIX systems (Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac os x, etc)

* switched between backend and frontend development, as well as tooling and API
  design.

* worked with many languages such as C, Java, Javascript (Nodejs, jQuery,
  angular1, react/redux/sagas, a bit of ember), Python (django, flask), PHP,
  Ruby, xQuery/xPath, SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL)

* lots of shell scripting (mainly awk and POSIX shell or extensions like bash),
  plus web interface markups (HTML5, Jade, CSS3 (also bootstrap), SSG, etc),

* infrastructure tools like apache, nginx, managing dependencies,

* a bit of packaging and logging, monitoring, and general troubleshooting live
  systems.

* I like vim, git, vagrant, ansible and arduinos.

* lately interested in functional programming, reactive systems, domain driven
  design and event sourcing.

* studying distributed systems, distributed transactions and the concerns
  around "microservices" (whatever that is :), including blockchain systems
  (Ethereum & smart contracts).

* got into SATOSA through a project that needed to extend pysaml and satosa to
  support the eIDAS specification, enabling the proxy to work between SAML2int
  and eIDAS nodes.
